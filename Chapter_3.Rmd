##Easy
These problems use the samples from the posterior distribution for the globe tossing example.
This code will give you a specific set of samples, so that you can check your answers exactly

```{r Easy}
length.out <- 1001
n_water <- 6
n_trials  <- 9

d <-
  tibble(p_grid     = seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = length.out),
         prior      = 1) %>% 
  mutate(likelihood = dbinom(n_water, size = n_trials, prob = p_grid)) %>% 
  mutate(posterior  = (likelihood * prior) / sum(likelihood * prior))

# How many samples would you like?
n_samples <- 1e4

# Make it reproducible
set.seed(3)

# Draw samples
samples <-
  d %>% 
  sample_n(size = n_samples, weight = posterior, replace = T)
```

```

```

```

**3E6.** Which values of p contain the narrowest interval equal to 66% of the posterior probability?

**SOLUTION**

solution <- 
  samples %>% 
  select(p_grid) %>% 
  pull() %>% 
  HPDI(prob = 0.66)

print(paste0("The values of p between ", round(solution[1],2), " and ", round(solution[2],2), " contain the narrowest interval equal to 66% of the posterior probability "))
```

**3E7.** Which values of p contain 66% of the posterior probability, assuming equal posterior probability
both below and above the interval?

**SOLUTION**
```{r 3E7}
solution <- 
  samples %>% 
  select(p_grid) %>% 
  pull() %>% 
  PI(prob = 0.66)

print(paste0("The values of p between ", round(solution[1],2), " and ", round(solution[2],2), " contain 66% of the posterior probability "))
```

##Medium
**3M1.** Suppose the globe tossing data had turned out to be 8 water in 15 tosses. Construct the posterior
distribution, using grid approximation. Use the same flat prior as before.

**SOLUTION**
```{r 3M1, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6, fig.align = "left"}
length.out <- 1001
n_water <- 8
n_trials  <- 15

data3M1 <-
  tibble(p_grid     = seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = length.out),
         prior      = 1) %>% 
  mutate(likelihood = dbinom(n_water, size = n_trials, prob = p_grid)) %>% 
  mutate(posterior  = (likelihood * prior) / sum(likelihood * prior))

ggplot(data = data3M1, 
       aes(x = p_grid, y = posterior)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Proportion water",
       y = "Density") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  ggtitle("Poteriors with 8 waters in 15 tosses")
```

**3M2.** Draw 10,000 samples from the grid approximation from above. Then use the samples to calculate
the 90% HPDI for p.

**SOLUTION**

We will first calculate the HPDI
```{r 3M2.1}
# How many samples would you like?
n_samples <- 1e4

# Make it reproducible
set.seed(3)

# Draw samples
samples3M2 <-
  data3M1 %>% 
  sample_n(size = n_samples, weight = posterior, replace = T)

solution <- 
  samples3M2 %>% 
  select(p_grid) %>% 
  pull() %>% 
  HPDI(prob = 0.90)

print(paste0("The values of p between ", round(solution[1],2), " and ", round(solution[2],2), " contain the narrowest interval equal to 66% of the posterior probability "))
```

And now we will plot the interval in along with the sampled distribution.

```{r 3M2.2, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6, fig.align = "left"}
ggplot(data = samples3M2, 
       aes(x = p_grid)) +
  geom_density(fill = "red", 
               alpha = .3) +
  geom_ribbon(data = samples3M2 %>% filter(p_grid < solution[2] & p_grid > solution[1]),
              aes(ymin = 0, ymax = posterior*n_samples/10),
              fill = "red", 
              alpha = .7) +
  geom_line(data = data3M1, 
            aes(x = p_grid, y = posterior*n_samples/10), 
            linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(x = "Proportion water (p)",
       y = "Density") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  ggtitle("HPDI of the sample distribution with 8 waters in 15 tosses")
```

**3M3.** Construct a posterior predictive check for this model and data. This means simulate the distribution
of samples, averaging over the posterior uncertainty in p. What is the probability of observing
8 water in 15 tosses?

**SOLUTION**

Let's plot again the posterior of **3M1.**:

```{r 3M3.1, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6, fig.align = "left"}
ggplot(data = data3M1, 
       aes(x = p_grid, y = posterior)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Proportion water",
       y = "Density") +
    geom_segment(data = . %>% 
                 filter(p_grid %in% c(seq(from = .1, to = .9, by = .1), 3 / 10)),
                 aes(xend = p_grid,
                   y = 0, yend = posterior),
               size = .3, linetype = "dashed", 
               color = "black", show.legend = F) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  ggtitle("Posterior with 8 waters in 15 tosses")
```

Now we have the posterior we should draw samples with each of the ten possible parameter values.

```{r 3M3.2, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6, fig.align = "left"}
# Number of draws for each parameter value
n_draws <- 1e5

# Make it replicable
set.seed(3)

# A function to extract the number of waters in the draw
simulate_binom <- function(probability){
  rbinom(n_draws, size = 9, prob = probability) 
}

# A tibble with the number of waters for each of the parameter values
data_parameter <-
  tibble(probability = seq(from = .1, to = .9, by = .1)) %>% 
  mutate(draws       = purrr::map(probability, simulate_binom)) %>% 
  unnest(draws) %>% 
  mutate(label       = str_c("p = ", probability))

head(data_parameter)
```

and now let's plot the samples for each parameter value.

```{r 3M3.3, fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 10, fig.align = "left"}
data_parameter %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = draws)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, center = 0,
                 color = "grey92", size = 1/10) +
  scale_x_continuous(NULL, breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 9, by = 3)) +
  scale_y_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL) +
  labs(subtitle = "Sampling distributions") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,9)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~ label, ncol = 9) 
```

But... Why should we use only ten possible parameter values if our grid space has a thousand steps? Let's repeat the last step but using a thousan possible values, that is, approximating better the integral form of the Posterior predictive distribution: $$p(\hat{x}|data) = \int_{\Theta} p(\hat{x}|\Theta,data) p(\Theta|data) d\Theta$$

Whrere $\hat{x}$ is the sampled data, $\Theta$ the estimated parameter (percentage of water in our case) and $p(\Theta|data)$ the posterior distribution.

**3M4.** Using the posterior distribution constructed from the new (8/15) data, now calculate the probability
of observing 6 water in 9 tosses.

**SOLUTION**

**3M5.** Start over at 3M1, but now use a prior that is zero below p = 0.5 and a constant above p = 0.5.
This corresponds to prior information that a majority of the Earthâ€™s surface is water. Repeat each
problem above and compare the inferences. What difference does the better prior make? If it helps,
compare inferences (using both priors) to the true value p = 0.7.

**SOLUTION**
